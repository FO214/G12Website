              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                To start, I’d like to state I’m very disappointed with myself with this project. 

Our group definitely had the potential to create a great group project, however, we got way ahead of ourselves and reached too far forward in trying to create a chess engine. 

Not only did our group reach too far ahead, but we were also caught up with work with many other courses, which prevented us from completing our work.

When we realized that an engine was not within reason, I said that we should keep it to a 2 player chess game where opponents can play against each other. However, Omar disputed this and said he would rather do another idea, and this was when the assignment was already very late. This was after I had already done part in completing the back end as well. These last minute changes and disagreements are what resulted in our group not completing a group project. 

I would say our main errors were the lack of communication present between our group members, the ideas being too difficult, as well as the many last minute changes, and for future projects, I plan to personally improve on these factors.

              <p>Work distribution (Only the backend was done):</p>
              <p>Omar - 40/400 (The planning doc was done by Omar)</p>
              <p>Fahmi - 100/400</p>
              <p>Min - 0/400</p>
              <p>Ledio - 0/400</p>
